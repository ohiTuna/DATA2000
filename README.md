# DATA2000 Physician Count Scraper
This is a tool for scraping state physician DATA2000 waiver counts from SAMHSA available at: https://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment/physician-program-data/certified-physicians      

This is useful for checking trends in DATA2000 approved doctors. This tool is likely more for researchers or journalists in terms of interest. 


### STATUS/VERSION    
**project is currently idle but may be resumed in future**

**0.01a - 4/25/18** - Decided to make this tool available publicly. It currently **DOES NOT** correctly output to csv as intended. I will eventually update it and have it fixed. However, **if you a journalist or researcher and need this tool or the data PLEASE contact me and I will be happy to hurry a fix through or, at the least, send you a spreadsheet with the most current annual data** just send me a message: rjmarti2 AT millersville.edu



#### What is DATA2000? Why would a physician have a DATA2000 waiver?
Physicians in the U.S. are required to obtain a DATA2000 waiver to be allowed to legally treat opiate dependence and prescribe drugs like Suboxone, Zubsolv, Subutex, etc ( Buprenorphine with/without naloxone )
