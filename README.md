# DATA2000 Physician Count Scraper
This is a tool for scraping state physician DATA2000 waiver counts from SAMHSA available at: https://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment/physician-program-data/certified-physicians      

This is useful for checking trends in DATA2000 approved doctors. This tool is likely more for researchers or journalists in terms of interest. 


### STATUS/VERSION    
**project is currently idle but may be resumed in future**

**0.01a - 4/25/18** - Decided to make this tool available publicly. It currently **DOES NOT** correctly output to csv as intended. I will eventually update it and have it fixed. However, **if you a journalist or researcher and need this tool or the data PLEASE contact me and I will be happy to hurry a fix through or, at the least, send you a spreadsheet with the most current annual data** (last pulled late 2017), just send me a message: rjmarti2 AT millersville.edu



#### What is DATA2000? Why would a physician have a DATA2000 waiver?
A doctor would get a DATA2000 waiver to be allowed to legally treat opiate dependence and prescribe drugs like Suboxone, Zubsolv, Subutex, etc ( Buprenorphine with/without naloxone ). Legally, a dentist, psychiatrist, etc can write a prescription for 240 80mg Oxycontin doses after seeing a patient for the first time. However, if a patient comes in and states they are addicted to Oxycontin and need help a doctor is not allowed to prescribe them anything for it (Suboxone or Methadone) unless they have a DATA2000 waiver... something <1% of physicians have.
